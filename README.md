# Sales-Insights
### In this project, Iâ€™ve simulated a business problem resolution to a hardware company "AtliQ Hardware" in India.
### I used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to take a look into the data, and Power BI for ETL and visualizations to create a simple and informative dashboard about the company sales to get the insights.
