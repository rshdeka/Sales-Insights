# Sales-Insights
### In this project, Iâ€™ve simulated a business problem resolution to a hardware company "AtliQ Hardware" in India.
### I used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to take a look into the data, and Power BI for ETL and visualizations to create a simple and informative dashboard about the company sales to get the insights.
### The goal is to unlock Sales Insights that are not visible before for the sales team for providing decision support. 
### To support data-driven decision making, I have come up with an automated dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights.
